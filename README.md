### Step-by-Step Guide: Server Provisioning and Deployment  

##. Crafting the Web Page##

- Developed a lightweight HTML page enhanced with minimal CSS for styling, using Visual Studio Code as the primary editor.  
- Prioritized a clean, professional aesthetic to ensure a sleek and straightforward user experience.  

##2. Provisioning the Server##

- Set up a virtual server instance using AWS EC2:  
  - Created an instance with a custom name, generated a key pair for secure access, and established a security group.  
  - Configured the security group to permit HTTP traffic on port 80 for web accessibility.  
- Successfully launched the EC2 instance and accessed the server via SSH, using Termius as the terminal client.
  
### 3. **Installing and Configuring Nginx##

Installed Nginx on the server using the following commands:
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install nginx -y  
sudo systemctl start nginx  
sudo systemctl enable nginx  

Verified the installation by accessing the server's public IP address in a web browser to confirm the default Nginx welcome page was successfully displayed.


### 4. **Transferring Project Files##


Leveraged WinSCP, a file transfer tool, to manually upload the project folder (cloudproject) to the server. Alternatively, the following command can be used:
sudo cp -r ~/cloudproject/* /var/www/html/  
Verified the successful transfer by listing the contents of Nginx's root directory with:
ls -l /var/www/html  

---
### 5. **Enabling HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt##
Installed the necessary tools for managing SSL certificates:

sudo apt update  
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y  
Secured the domain dubem.web.jumpingcrab.com by obtaining and installing a free SSL certificate:
sudo certbot --nginx -d jessica.web.strangled.net 
This command seamlessly configured the Nginx server to enable HTTPS, ensuring secure and encrypted communication.

---
### 6. **Verifying the SSL Certificate##

Verified the SSL certificate by visiting https://jessica.web.strangled.net
Ensured the secure connection was active by checking for the padlock icon in the browser‚Äôs address bar.
---
### 7. **Running the Web Page**  

Refreshed the browser using the public IP address or domain to display the deployed landing page.
